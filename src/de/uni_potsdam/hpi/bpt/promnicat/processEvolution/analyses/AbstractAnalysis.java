 * Every analysis shares several attributes. There is two ways to create them:
 * 1. with models that shall be analyzed
 * 2. with 1. and also models that have been analyzed already
 * In the second case, the two model collections are merged at the end of the analysis
 * and the merged collection is returned. With that, 
 * in a chain of analyses you can pass the results
 * on and work with them in a later analysis for example.
 * Also you do not have to keep the results in separate variables
 * after every analysis for example.
