 * This class ensures the mapping of the databaseId.
 * Field types that can automatically be mapped to the database are:
 * boolean, String, short, int, double, long, float and their classes
 * References to other objects are stored also.
 * Arrays, Lists, Sets and Maps can be stored if their content is not too complex.
 * For details see: http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/Types

 * Make sure to add an empty constructor! Getter and Setter for all fields are not needed.
